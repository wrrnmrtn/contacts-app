# Contacts-Page
Submission for my Resonate Technical Test Q2
------------------------------------------------------
Good Day! I used ReactJS to create a page for Contacts. Here's how to run the application:
1. Download my repository here into a ZIP file.
2. Locate the ZIP file and extract it into a folder.
3. Locate and copy the location path of the project folder.
4. Run the command prompt. Use the cd command to get into the project folder like the example below:
```
cd {location path of the project folder} (ex. cd C:/contacts-app)
```
5. To make sure that the project is fully functioning, kindly install the following packages using node package manager in the project folder:
```
npm install axios
npm install @mui/material
npm install @mui/icons-material
```
Note: Make sure you have NodeJS to execute these command lines in the command prompt, you can download it for free in https://nodejs.org/en/download

6. Run the application in the command prompt using 
```
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

Thank you!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
